The front page reads the title "3 people killed! Downtown Serial Killer?". I flip to the page of the story and learn that the killing have happened on consecutive days, all between the hours of 10pm to 2am. The three killings have all been within a 20 block radius of each other. It's 9:30pm  now.

**[2a]** Drive downtown to look for the killer.

I hop in my car to go pick up my colleague to head downtown. My colleague seemed very troubled about this
case because he knew one of the victims and was determined to find the killer. This made me sad and angry so
I vowed to him that we would find this killer. We finally reached downtown and seen the sobbing families of
the victims. 
**[2b]** Interview families of the victims from police report on desk.

I immediately reached out to my colleague who informed me that there was lead in the case and the case was handed over to the homicide investigation department. I shared all I knew about the case with the homocide department in aid to locate this killer as quickly as we can.
